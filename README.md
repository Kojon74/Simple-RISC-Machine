# Simple-RISC-Machine

Over the course of multiple weeks, my lab partner and I built a Turing complete RISC machine programmed with Verilog using ModelSim and Quartus. This machine could compute any calculation given enough time and memory. To create this machine we used RAM modules, finite state machines and program counters.
